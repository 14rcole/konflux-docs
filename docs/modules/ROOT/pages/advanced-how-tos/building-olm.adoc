Building an OLM

 Ok so the basic basics are
Create an app for the operator
Add your controller/operator as a component. It should share a git repo with other components. So specify it’s Dockerfile within that repo.
Add your bundle as another component. Same repo, different Dockerfile.
Add a SHA reference to the bundle’s csv. Then, in Konflux, define the relationship: controller nudges bundle.
Add FBC as another application.
