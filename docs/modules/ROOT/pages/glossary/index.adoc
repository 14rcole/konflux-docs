**{ProductName}** +
A platform to automate the process of building, testing, and releasing applications. {ProductName} offers enterprise-grade security and customizable feature sets.

**build pipeline** +
A Tekton PipelineRun which converts from source code to a built and tested artifact in a container registry.

**build pipeline customization** +
The ability to update and manage build pipelines for each component in an application.

**build-time tests** +
A specific TaskRun which is included in a build pipeline but does not required to convert from the source control to the produced artifact. This may include any number of functional or security checks produced on the source code or the produced artifact.

**cluster** +
A Kubernetes deployment with nodes that run containerized applications and a control plane that manages the nodes.

**component** +
An internal representation of a software artifact that {ProductName} builds and tests, using source code from a git repository. Components are stored an link:https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec[OCI container registry] such as quay.io after they are built.

**Enterprise Contract (EC)** +
A set of release policies that you apply to your application snapshot. You can use the EC to prevent releases that are not compliant with Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) guidelines. 

**integration test** +
A pipeline defined in source control that is run after the completion of a component's build pipeline. Integration tests are run against all components in a snapshot as a whole.

**IntegrationTestScenario (ITS)** +
A Kubernetes resource that defines a pipeline to run for an integration test. The integration service uses the ITS to test application components.

**managed workspace** +
A workspace that mirrors some details of an already existing workspace. Supporting teams can create a managed workspace to grant limited permissions to development teams in the production environment.

**pipelines as code** +
A practice that defines pipelines by using source code in Git. Pipelines as Code is also the name of link:https://pipelinesascode.com[a subsystem] that executes those pipelines.

**PipelineRun** +
A collection of TaskRuns that are arranged in a specific order of execution. 

**provenance** +
Metadata describing where, when, and how the associated software artifact was produced.

**release pipeline** +
A generic Tekton pipeline that moves artifacts built within {ProductName} to somewhere outside of its control. An application snapshot must pass the Enterprise Contract test before {ProductName} can run the release pipeline. 

**security testing** +
A process that determines if images meet security quality standards.

**snapshot** +
An immutable set of component references. The system creates a snapshot when it finishes running a component's build pipeline based on all other components in its application. A snapshot defines a set of components which are either tested or released together.

**Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)** +
A link:https://slsa.dev/[security framework] that helps prevent tampering by securing the packages and infrastructure of customersâ€™ projects.

**task** +
One or more steps that run container images. Each container image performs a piece of construction work.

**TaskRun** +
A process that executes a task on a cluster with inputs, outputs, and execution parameters. {ProductName} creates a TaskRun on its own, or as a part of a PipelineRun for each task in a pipeline.

**Tekton** +
A Knative-based framework for CI/CD pipelines. Tekton is decoupled which means that you can use one pipeline to deploy to any Kubernetes cluster in multiple hybrid cloud providers. Tekton stores everything that is related to a pipeline in the cluster.

**Tekton chains** +
A mechanism to secure the software supply chain by recording events in a user-defined pipeline.

**Tekton integration testing** +
A process that uses Tekton tasks to support the setup and execution of dynamic application tests against container images.

**Tekton results** +
A mechanism that stores PipelineRun and TaskRun metadata in a separate database and underlying pod logs in cloud storage. After this metadata is stored in a separate database, the original resources are removed from the cluster.

**workspace** +
A storage volume that a task requires at runtime to receive input or provide output.
