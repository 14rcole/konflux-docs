= Using Red Hat activation keys to access subscription content

Most Red Hat software requires a subscripition to access. Activation keys are the preferred method for using Red Hat subscriptions with Konflux builds and are supported by the all types of container builds, including hermetic builds using the prefetch-dependencies task.

NOTE: Previously, mounting entitlement certificates directly as secrets was advocated but this is discouraged by Red Hat since those certificates are intended to be regularly revoked and refreshed by the subscription-manager system. Direct use of entitlement certificates is still supported by Konflux but discouraged. Entitlement certificate docs are xref:./entitlement-subscription.adoc[here].

To learn how to create an activation keys see the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/subscription_central/1-latest/html/getting_started_with_activation_keys_on_the_hybrid_cloud_console/index[Red Hat documentation].

When your activation key is created, you will need to create a secret with two values: your "org id" and the name of your activation key.


== Adding activation keys to the workspace

You will need to create one or more secrets in your Konflux namespace (one per activation key). First, decide what to name the secrets and the scope they should have. You can control the scope of the activation key you add with the name.

=== Adding subscription entitlement for an entire workspace

Both the `+buildah+` and `+prefetch-dependencies+` tasks accept an activation key with a default name of `+activation-key+`. If you use this name for your secret, all of the builds in your workspace will automatically use the activation key.

=== Adding subscription entitlement for a specific component build
Sometimes, you only want certain builds to have the activation key, particularly when you need to have more than one key with different repository configurations in the same workspace. To do this, choose a different name for your activation key secret (not `+activation-key+`). Then, add a parameter to your ccomponent's pipeline yaml:

----
- name: ACTIVATION_KEY
  value: my-secret-name
----

== Create the activation key secrets

[[Create-activation-key-through-the-UI]]
=== Create activation key secret through the UI

. Access the Secrets section in the konflux UI and click on *Add secret*.
. Set the secret name to activation-key.
. Add the first key with the name *org* and and set the value to your org id.
. Add a second key with the name *activationkey* and set the value to the name of your activation key.
. Save the secret by clicking *Add secret*

[[Create-activation-key-through-console]]
=== Create activation key secret through console

Alternatively, you can create the secret through the CLI. After logging into your cluster and navigating to your namespace, run the following command:

----
kubectl create secret generic activation-key -n <your-tenant> --from-literal=org=<your org id> --from-literal=activationkey=<your activation key name>
----


== Using subscription content in a build

=== Non-hermetic (network connected) builds:

==== Automatic registration

The buildah task will use a provided activation key to register itself with Red Hat subscription manager and mount the necessary certificates to the build environment. Simply add `+dnf+` or `+yum install+` commands to your Containerfile. 

TIP: If your activation key includes more than the default repositories, add the following command inside your Containerfile in order update repository metadata:

----
subscription-manager --refresh
----

==== Explicit registration

If you include a `+subscription-manager register+`  command in your Containerfile, automatic registration will be disabled. You can control subscription-manager directly using the normal commands.

=== Hermetic (network isolated) builds:

The prefetch-dependencies task can use an activation key to register and fetch RPMs. All repositories configured for the activation key will be enabled for prefetch. 
If the default name was used for the secret (activation-key) no configuration is necessary. Otherwise, provide the ACTIVATION_KEY parameter to the build pipeline as noted above.

=== Configuring an rpm lockfile for hermetic builds

The rpm-lockfile-prototype tool uses live dnf metadata to resolve a given rpms.in.yaml file into an rpms.lock.yaml file in which every rpm is exactly specified by location and version. Because it uses live metadata, the configuration of dnf repositories on the system will influence the results.

Let's explore a simple scenario that should illustrate all pertinent parts of the process.

We will create a lockfile that includes the OpenShift clients rpm `+openshift-clients+` which:

* requires a subscription to the OpenShift product
* is not located in the default Red Hat Enterprise Linux repositories
* is available for multiple architectures


This RPM is available in the following repositories:

[cols="2,1"]
|===
|*architecture* |*repository*
|x86_64 |rhocp-4.17-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms
|aarch64 |rhocp-4.17-for-rhel-9-aarch64-rpms
|===


==== Create the activation key

===== Create a new key.
Navigate to https://console.redhat.com/insights/connector/activation-keys and create a new activation key. Follow the instructions in the wizard. 

Refer to the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/subscription_central/1-latest/html/getting_started_with_activation_keys_on_the_hybrid_cloud_console/index[Red Hat documentation] for additional information.


===== Add additional repositories to the key
Once the key is created, click "add repositories". Add all the applicable repositories for all architectures. If you want to build source containers include the corresponding source repositories as well.

.Selecting additional repositories for an actviation keys
image::activation-key-choose-repos.png[redhat-activation-key-configuration]

When saved, your key should look something like this:

.Activation Key with additoinal repositories configured
image::activation-key-additional-repos-view.png[redhat-activation-key-additional-respositories]

IMPORTANT: Note the *name* of the activation key and the *org ID* which can be found in the dropdown under your name in the top right corner of the screen. You will need both in a subsequent step.

==== Configure rpm-lockfile-prototype

NOTE: For this step we willl assume that you have source code in your current working directory `+$(pwd)+`.


1. Start a new container using the right version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (the one you will eventually be building on) and mounting your source code directory:

----
podman run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/source registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9 
----

[start=2]
. Register with your activation key:
----
subscription-manager register --activationkey="$KEY_NAME" --org="$ORG_ID"
----


[start=3]
. Verify that you have the correct repositories and enable missing source repositories.
NOTE: It is normal to only see the repositories for your current architecture at this stagitge.

You must locate the source repos in redhat.repo and change `+ENABLED = 0+` to `+ENABLED = 1+`.

. configure rpms.in.yaml
There are three things to configure:
.. Add `./redhat.repo` under `contentOrigin.repofiles` in rpms.in.yaml and added
.. Add the rpm we want (openshift-clients)
.. Configure the enabled architectures

Example `+rpms.in.yaml+` file:
----                                                                                                                            
contentOrigin:
  # Define at least one source of packages, but you can have as many as you want.
  repofiles:
     - ./redhat.repo

packages:
  # list of rpm names to resolve
  - ocp-clients

#reinstallPackages: []
  # list of rpms already provided in the base image, but which should be
  # reinstalled

arches:
  # The list of architectures can be set in the config file. Any `--arch` option set
  # on the command line will override this list.
  - aarch64
  - x86_64
  # - s390x
  # - ppc64le

context:
    # Alternative to setting command line options. Usually you will only want
    # to include one of these options, with the exception of `flatpak` that
    # can be combined with `image` and `containerfile` 
    containerfile: Containerfile
----

NOTE: In the source directory for this example there is a Containerfile named `+Containerfile+` which starts with the line `FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi`

[start=9]
Create the lockfile:
----
cd /source rpm-lockfile-prototype -f Containerfile rpms.in.yaml
----

TIP: if you see output like "`+WARNING:root:No sources found for...+`" then there is a source repository that still needs to be enabled in your repository configuraiton.

[start=10]
Finally, commit the rpms.in.yaml, rpms.lock.yaml and redhat.repo to source control for use with the rpm prefetch task.
