= Customizing the build pipeline

To meet your specific needs, you can customize the way that {ProductName} builds components. You can customize builds in two ways:

* Change the parameters of the build pipeline of a component.
* Extend the pipeline with your own tasks (or delete existing tasks).

For example, you can change for how long {ProductName} saves the container images of component, by changing the value of the `image-expires-after` parameter. Or you can ensure that the container images it builds for a component are compliant with regulations for your industry, by adding a compliance check as a task to its build pipeline. 


.Procedure

To customize the build pipeline in any way, start by taking the following steps:

. In your preferred IDE, navigate to the `.tekton` directory in the repository of your component.

. Open the `testrepo-pull-request.yaml` file in the repository.
 

== Changing parameters

.Procedure

. In this `.yaml` file in the `.tekton` directory, customize the parameters of the build pipeline by changing the pipeline `params`:
.. Pipeline params have the paths `.spec.params` and `.pipelineSpec.params`
.. Change the default `value` of existing parameters. For example, you can set the value of `image-expires-after` to `2w`, instead of `5d` 
.. Add parameters. New parameters must include a `name` and `value`.
. Commit your changes to the repository of the component.


== Extending the build pipeline with your own tasks

Before you extend your build pipeline, be aware that doing so causes builds to fail an link:https://enterprisecontract.dev/docs/ec/main/index.html[Enterprise Contract] check, if you are using the EC. To resolve this issue, please reference the next procedure after completing this one.  

.Procedure

. In each `.yaml` file in the `.tekton` directory, add a new task under `tasks`. 

+ 
Example task:
+
[source]
--
  name: example-task
  params:
  - name: example-param
    value: “Example”
  runAfter:
  - build-container #You can be more specific by choosing another task
  taskRef:
    params:
    - name: name
      value: example-task # metadata.name field of the Task
    - name: bundle
      value: quay.io/tekton-bundle-catalog/example-task-bundle:1.0
      # For more details on tekton bundles, refer https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/pipelines/#tekton-bundles
    - name: kind
      value: task
    resolver: bundles
  when:
  - input: $(params.skip-checks)    #This references the pipeline parameters
    operator: in
    values:
    - "false"
--

+
An example of a custom task added to the pipeline that sends a slack notification when the `Pipelinerun` fails:
+
[source]
--
  name: slack-webhook-notification
  params:
    - name: message
      value: PipelineRun $(context.pipelineRun.name) failed
    - name: secret-name
      value: my-secret # name of secret in the your namespace which contains slack web-hook URL under key specified in 'key-name' parameter below
    - name: key-name
      value: dev-team
  taskRef:
    params:
    - name: bundle
      value: quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-slack-webhook-notification:0.1
    - name: name
      value: slack-webhook-notification
    - name: kind
      value: Task
    resolver: bundles
  when:
    - input: $(tasks.status)
      operator: in
      values: ["Failed"]
--

. Commit your changes to the repository of the component.

[NOTE] 
====
* To use `slack-webhook-notification` task, you need to create a secret in your namespace with at least one key where the value is the webhook URL. For example, to create a secret for Slack, run `oc create secret generic my-secret --from-literal dev-team=https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/XXXXXX`

* If you want to define a task directly in this file, rather than using `taskRef`, you can use `taskSpec`. Visit the documentation linked in the <<additional-resources>> section.

== Preventing issues with the Enterprise Contract

If you are using the Enterprise Contract (EC) to verify your builds, then extending your build pipeline causes your builds to fail the EC. Specifically, builds begin to violate the "trusted tasks" rule.  

At the time of publication, the easiest solution for this problem we can recommend is to skip the trusted tasks check. 

.Procedure 

. In the repository for your instance of Konflux, find the version of the EC that your pipeline is using in the following directory: `/konflux-ci/enterprise-contract/core`. 
.. By default, Konflux uses `enterprise-contract-service_appstudio.redhat.com_v1alpha1_enterprisecontractpolicy_default.yaml`.
. Find this line: `exclude: []`
. Between the brackets, insert the value `trusted_task.trusted`.
. Commit this change to the repository.

== Exchanging the build pipeline build task with higher memory limits

The `buildah` task, which builds components from a Dockerfile, has a memory limit of 4 GB. To build components with memory requirements greater than 4 GB, use the following tasks:

* link:https://quay.io/repository/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-buildah-6gb?tab=tags[quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-buildah-6gb]
* link:https://quay.io/repository/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-buildah-8gb?tab=tags[quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-buildah-8gb]
* link:https://quay.io/repository/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-buildah-10gb?tab=tags[quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-buildah-10gb]

.Procedure

To exchange the build task with a memory limit of 6 GB, complete the following steps. For a memory limit of 8 or 10 GB, replace the references to 6 GB with the appropriate values.

. Go to the GitHub repo of your component.
. In each .yaml file in the .tekton directory, under tasks, locate the task named build-container:
.. Under `.taskRef.params`, set `name` to `buildah-6gb`.
.. Under `.taskRef.params`, set `bundle` to `quay.io/redhat-appstudio-tekton-catalog/task-buildah-6gb:0.1`.

== Bring your own Quay repository to the build pipeline

By default, all pipelines push the images to a local repository that is set up as a part of installation. Ths registry address is registry-service.kind-registry:5001. It is not mandatory to use this local repo, so if you want to use your own Quay repo to control user permissions, you can do this by following link:https://github.com/konflux-ci/konflux-ci/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#configuring-a-push-secret-for-the-build-pipeline[the instructions] for configuring a push secret for the build piepline.

== Verification

When you commit changes to these `.yaml` files in your repository, {ProductName} automatically triggers a new build. Wait for {ProductName} to complete the new build, then verify your changes have been made by following these steps:

. Navigate to *Activity > Pipeline runs*.
. Select the most recent build pipeline run. 
. In the *Details* tab, confirm that there are new tasks that you added in the pipeline visualization.
. In the *Logs* tab, confirm the following:
.. Any new tasks are in the navigation bar. 
.. If you changed a parameter's value, and that value gets printed, the new value is in the log.

== Troubleshooting

If you experience any issues with your customized pipeline, try the following solutions:

* If you believe that your desired parameter values are not being passed into the pipeline, make sure that your assignment of that value doesn't get overwritten later in the `.yaml` file.

* If your new task is not appearing in the pipeline run, ensure the following:
** You added it to the correct place in the `.yaml` files, so that it has the path `.spec.params` or `.pipelineSpec.params`. 
** You specified a valid `runAfter` field, and that the task in that field completed successfully.

* For problems with both parameters and tasks, make sure you committed your changes to the `.tekton` directory in the repository that {ProductName} references for the component.

* If your build pipeline can no longer successfully run, your best option is to simply rebuild the `.tekton` directory:
** Use the link:https://github.com/konflux-ci/testrepo/tree/main/.tekton[template `.tekton` directory] to rebuild your own `.tekton` directory.
