= Deleting applications and components

You can delete an application if you are a user with the workspace admin role.

WARNING: If you delete an application permanently, you delete all the components and resources from the user interface (UI) and upstream repositories. This includes Tekton pipeline definitions and other resources managed in those repositories. The deletion process submits a pull request (PR) to remove these pipeline definitions and associated resources.
