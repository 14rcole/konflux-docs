== No space left on device

Tasks may fail with an error message mentioning `No space left on device` as the underlying error.
This likely means your build pipeline wrote more data than expected into a shared volume.

Typically seen in the `clone-repository` or `prefetch-dependencies` task in a build pipeline.

For the clone task, the error message may look similar to:

[source,text]
----
[clone] {"level":"error","ts":1721904304.0047252,"caller":"git/git.go:53","msg":"Error running git [checkout -f FETCH_HEAD]: exit status 128\nerror: unable to write file ...: No space left on device\n"
----

The device that's running out of space is most likely the workspace declared in your `PipelineRun`
YAML files. *The solution is to request more disk space.* In the `.spec.workspaces` section in
all the relevant PipelineRun files, increase the storage request.

[source,yaml]

  # ...

            requests:
              storage: 1Gi  # increase accordingly
